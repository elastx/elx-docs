*ELASTX Private Kubernetes* consists of a fully redundant cluster spread over three different physical locations in Stockholm, Sweden. Managed and monitored by us 24x7. You also have access to our support at any time.

If you run services in our OpenStack platform you can have workloads alongside your Kubernetes cluster.

When you schedule services, there are some things to be aware of in order to fully take advantage of the possibilities we provide. With that said, you can use all tooling that supports a standard setup of Kubernetes.
