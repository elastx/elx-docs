## Versions

* Kubernetes 1.20.7
* Nginx-ingress: 0.46.0
* Certmanager: 1.3.1

## Major changes

* RBAC api `rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1alpha1` has been removed. Instead use the replacement `rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1`.
* We no longer supports new clusters being created with pod security policy enabled. Instead we recommend using [OPA Gatekeeper](https://open-policy-agent.github.io/gatekeeper/website/docs/), in case you have any questions regarding this contact [our support](https://support.elastx.se/) and we will help you guys out.

## Deprecations

* Ingress api `extensions/v1beta1` will be removed in kubernetes 1.22.
* Kubernetes beta lables on nodes are deplricated and will be removed in a future release, follow the below list to se what lable replaces the old one:
  * `beta.kubernetes.io/instance-type` -> `node.kubernetes.io/instance-type`
  * `beta.kubernetes.io/arch` -> `kubernetes.io/arch`
  * `beta.kubernetes.io/os` -> `kubernetes.io/os`
  * `failure-domain.beta.kubernetes.io/region` -> `topology.kubernetes.io/region`
  * `failure-domain.beta.kubernetes.io/zone` -> `topology.kubernetes.io/zone`
* Certmanager api `v1alpha2`, `v1alpha3` and `v1beta1` will be removed in a future release. We strongly recommend that you upgrade to the new `v1` api.
* RBAC api `rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1beta1` will be removed in an upcoming release. The apis are replaced with `rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1`.
* Pod Security Policies will be removed in Kubernetes 1.25 in all clusters having the feature enabled. Instead we recommend [OPA Gatekeeper](https://open-policy-agent.github.io/gatekeeper/website/docs/).


## Is downtime expected

The upgrade drains (moving all workload from) one node at the time, patches that node and brings it back in the cluster. First after all deployments and statefulsets are running again we will continue on with the next node.

## Known issues

### Custom node taints and labels lost during upgrade

All custom taints and labels on nodes are lost during upgrade.

### Custom changes to non -customer security groups will be lost

All changes to security groups not suffixed with "-customer" will be lost during the upgrade

### Snapshots is not working

There is currently a limitation in the snapshot controller not making it topology aware.
