The purpose of Elastx Identity is to provide a Single Sign-on experience
for access to the different Elastx service offerings. Available as a tech
preview, the service provides integration with
[OpenStack IaaS](https://elastx.se/en/openstack) to enable usage/enforcement
of multi-factor authentication.


## Join tech preview
If you're organization is interested in taking part of the tech preview,

## Update account settings
Users in organizations which have enrolled for tech preview can use the
["My Account" web page](https://auth.elastx.cloud/my_account) to change
their password, configure multi-factor authentication and similar account
related settings.


## Supported MFA methods
In addition to username and password for authentication, the tech preview
provides the ability to configure multi-factor authentication using either
TOTP, supported by mobile applications such as "Google Authenticator" and
"[FreeOTP](https://freeotp.github.io/)"), or the Webauthn standard which
enables usage of hardware tokens such as the Yubikey.
