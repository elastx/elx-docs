## Overview

By default we block traffic to internet on tcp port 25. We do this to prevent abuse, mail abuse is very common and we do our best to prevent this from happening.

## Alternatives

If you want to send e-mail from our platform we recommend using our Mail Relay service. All major SMTP services offer their service on other ports than port 25.

This way you can get an automated reliable SMTP service that is very cost effective.

You can read more about our Mail Relay offering [here](https://elastx.se/en/mail-relay/). Contact us if you have any other questions.
