## 2024-02-01 DDoS protection now included

We are happy to announce that we are now adding our DDoS protection to all Elastx Cloud Platform customers for free. This is yet another step in our mission to provide the best cloud platform for business critical services with sensitive data. Your services will now be protected from L3/L4 volumetric DDoS attacks by our inline protection.

If you already are an Elastx customer you do not need to do anything, the DDoS protection service will be enabled automatically. If you are currently subscribing to our DDoS protection service, your subscription will be updated accordingly.

This will apply from 2024-02-01.

## 2023-05-02 Cloud Colocation
We are happy to announce these platform news that will help you to run applications on Elastx Cloud Platform with enhanced security.

### Cloud Colocation
Cloud Colocation is a service that enables customers to host their own hardware in the same data centers as the Elastx platform. This could, for example, be hardware security modules (HSM) for storing and managing secrets if required to manage that on your own.

Customers can acquire individual rack units or a separate section in a rack and will receive a dedicated, fast, and private network connection to connect to the desired network in the Elastx platform via Cloud Connect. Customers can also interconnect with other cloud platforms using Elastx Cloud Exchange.

Physical access to the space is provided, and on-site staff is available to offer assistance if needed. Mounting equipment, including cables and rack screws, is included.

Cloud Colocation has been available since 2023-03-04

## 2023-01-27 Elastx Cloud Platform pricing adjustment

To Elastx Customers and Partners,<br />
We are trying to avoid a general price increase on all services, even though the current high inflation is affecting us hard. We are investing in new more efficient technology to compensate for the increased cost derived from product vendors, utility services, financial service and internal costs. We have identified a few selected services where we need to perform price adjustments to be able to continue the development in a sustainable way.<br />The new pricing will apply from 2023-03-01.


We will adjust the pricing on Professional Services and also reduce the number of different types to a minimum to make it easier.
