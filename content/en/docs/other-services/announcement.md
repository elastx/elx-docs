## 2022-01-27 Elastx Cloud Platform pricing adjustment

To Elastx Customers and Partners,<br />
We are trying to avoid a general price increase on all services, even though the current high inflation is affecting us hard. We are investing in new more efficient technology to compensate for the increased cost derived from product vendors, utility services, financial service and internal costs. We have identified a few selected services where we need to perform price adjustments to be able to continue the development in a sustainable way.<br />The new pricing will apply from 2023-03-01.


We will adjust the pricing on Professional Services and also reduce the number of different types to a minimum to make it easier.

| Service                                                  | Current price        | New price           
|----------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|-------------
| Professional Services CloudOps Engineer                  | 1150 SEK / Month     | 1500 SEK / Month              
| Professional services CloudOps Engineer non office hours | 2300 SEK / Month     | 3000 SEK / Month

We will adjust the pricing on Application Monitoring in order to be able to keep the high service levels and continue the development of the service.

| Service                         | Current price        | New price
|---------------------------------|----------------------|-------------
| Application Monitoring Basic    | 495 SEK / Month      | 2900 SEK / Month
| Application Monitoring Advanced | 7900 SEK / Month     | 14900 SEK / Month
