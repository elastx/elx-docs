## 2024-10-14 MSSQL DBaaS now available
We are excited to announce that we now have Microsoft SQL Server available in Elastx Database as a Service.

Elastx DBaaS automatically ensures your databases are reliable, secure, and scalable so that your business continues to run without disruption. You can achieve high availability and disaster protection by configuring replication and backups to protect your data. Backups and multi-node datastores are disaster protected as they are running over multiple availability zones which in our case are geographically separated data centers. Automatic failover makes your database highly available.

The following services are included as standard in our prices:
24x7 support, Threat Intelligence, DDoS protection, encrypted traffic between our availability zones and data encryption at rest.   

You can find detailed information, specifications and pricing here, https://elastx.se/en/mssql-dbaas.

If you have any general questions or would like to sign-up please contact us at hello@elastx.se.
Any technical questions please register a support ticket at https://support.elastx.se.
