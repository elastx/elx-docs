## Overview

If you're running any of the predefined image templates that exist in our Virtuozzo PaaS, it is important to keep your environments and their application stacks up to date in regards to security, features and support.

Since these templates are under constant development to provide fixes and enhancements, new releases are made continuously. This also means that after a while old releases are removed from the platform. 

In order to get a smooth upgrade experience, it is recommended to keep up to date with the newer releases, as this also enables you to rollback to an earlier (not yet removed) release if something is not working as expected - this is not possible if the release has been removed from the platform.

## Good to know
As always, remember to make sure your backups are working in case of failure when doing upgrades.
